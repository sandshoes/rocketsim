We will run a rocket sim out of this repository using mainly C++.

## Compile
- Run ```g++ -c *.cpp```
- Run ```g++ *.o -o a.out```
- Execute ```./a.out```

## Things to do:
- [x] Converter from cartesian coordinates to spherical, and the other way around.
- [] Study how to collect & process information for the simulation
- [] Add positional update and rocket thrust.
- [] Basic law of gases for thrust.
- [] Air drag.
- [] Gimbaled engine to let it turn.
- [] Basic thermodynamic behaviour.
- [] Stages.
- [] Add graphics (could be in C++ or another language).
